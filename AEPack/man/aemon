aemon is a program which runs in an infinite loop, constantly checking the count of specific items in the attached AE network and if the levels are lower than required places crafting orders.
Usage:
'aemon' to start the infinite loop/monitoring.
'aemon print|view|list' to print the currently configured items.
'aemon remove|delete <searchTerm>' to remove the specified item from configuration. The <searchTerm> is used to find the full item id.
'aemon add <searchTerm> <count>' to add or update the specified item to configuration. The <searchTerm> is used to find the full item id.
'aemon clear' clears the configuration, removing all configured items in the file.
